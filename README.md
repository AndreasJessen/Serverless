# tf-lambda-limit-one-entry
Script to limit entry on a Typeform to one per email address.

# What does it do?
You want to avoid people filling twice the same Typeform?
Using this serverless function we will update logic block on a typeform. It adds a new constraint every time someone fills the form for the best time.
If they try again they will be redirected to an error screen.

# How to use it?
Pre-requesites:
- a Typeform account, create one [here](https://)
- an AWS account, create one [here](https://aws.amazon.com)
- `aws-cli` installed and configured, [instructions](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [Serverless](https://serverless.com/framework/) framework installed locally - `npm install -g serverless`

## Get Typeform ready

1. Create a form if you don't have one.
2. Add an email field if you don't have one already.
3. Add a statement containing an explicit error message. We will display it when a user already filled the form.
4. Add sample logic between the email block and statement.
5. Get your typeform URL, and keep your form ID.
  `https://{ACCOUNT_NAME}.typeform.com/to/{FORM_ID}`
6. Hit `https://api.typeform.com/to/{FORM_ID}` directly in the browser.

7. Look at the JSON payload, under `fields` array and extract the `id` and `ref` of both the field you want to use as a unique identifier (email block) and the statement block.
8. Finally get yourself a Typeform personal token [here](https://admin.typeform.com/account#/section/tokens)

# Build your own
This is a showcase of what's doable to enrich your typeform fields with data. Using this function as an example you build more complex interactions.
